# HackerRank SQL Practice Problems

Language: SQL

## Overview

This folder contains my solutions to HackerRank SQL challenges. The problems focus on developing proficiency with SQL syntax, query formulation, and database concepts. This is part of my ongoing practice to strengthen data querying and relational database skills.

## Current Focus

Category: Easy-level challenges (beginner-friendly but essential for strong fundamentals).

## Topics Covered So Far:

* Basic `SELECT` queries
* Filtering with `WHERE`
* Working with attributes and IDs
* Querying city and station datasets

## Skills Demonstrated

* Translating problem statements into correct SQL queries.
* Using filtering and selection to extract relevant data.
* Practicing query readability and consistency.
* Building a foundation for more advanced SQL concepts.

## Portfolio Note

This repository is part of my academic and professional coding portfolio. It reflects consistent practice and a commitment to improving database querying skills. The repository will grow to include medium and hard-level SQL challenges over time. For more projects, see my GitHub profile: [github.com/brynja-schultz](https://github.com/brynja-schultz).
