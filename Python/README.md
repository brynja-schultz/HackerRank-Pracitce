# HackerRank Practice Problems

*Language: Python*

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to HackerRank coding challenges. The problems cover a broad range of fundamental programming concepts in Python, including algorithms, data structures, and core syntax. The purpose is to build accuracy, efficiency, and strong problem-solving skills through consistent practice.

---

## Structure  
Solutions are organized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and by topic. Files are labeled for clarity and follow the sequence of HackerRankâ€™s Python practice sets.  

---

## Topics Covered  
- Arithmetic and mathematical operations  
- Conditional logic and control flow  
- Loops and iteration  
- Lists, tuples, and comprehensions  
- Strings and text processing  
- Functions and modular code  
- Type conversion and input handling  
- Data structures and algorithms (growing coverage) 

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Translating problem statements into working Python code.
* Writing **clean, readable, well-structured solutions**.
* Applying debugging and testing to edge cases.
* Developing algorithmic thinking and scalability awareness.

## Portfolio Note

This repository is part of my academic and professional coding portfolio.
It reflects **consistent practice** and a commitment to strengthening both Python fluency and alogorithmic reasoning.
The repository will grow to include **medium and hard-level challenges** over time.
