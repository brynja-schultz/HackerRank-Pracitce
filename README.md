# HackerRank Practice Problems

**Languages:** SQL, Python

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to HackerRank challenges across SQL and Python. The problems are organized by language and difficulty, with a focus on building strong fundamentals in querying, algorithms, and problem-solving.

## Topics Covered

* SQL: SELECT statements, filtering, aggregation, joins, and database concepts
* Python: data structures, iteration, conditional logic, and basic algorithms

## Skills Demonstrated

* Writing clear and consistent SQL queries
* Applying filtering, aggregation, and joins to solve database problems
* Translating problem statements into working Python code
* Practicing clean code style and readability

## Repository Structure

* **SQL/** – HackerRank SQL problems grouped by difficulty
* **Python/** – HackerRank Python problems grouped by difficulty

## Portfolio Note

This repository is part of my academic and professional coding portfolio. It reflects consistent practice and a commitment to improving database querying skills. The repository will grow to include medium and hard-level SQL challenges over time. For more projects, see my GitHub profile: github.com/brynja-schultz.
Do you want me to also make **mini-READMEs for each difficulty folder** (e.g., `SQL/01-EASY`) so they look polished too, or keep the details only at the top level and per-language?
